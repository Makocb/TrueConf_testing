# TrueConf_testing

# Installation

You can download or clone this repo and build it in VS
If you are using windows, use g++ TrueConf_test.cpp in command prompt(this is a "single file app")

# Program functions
this program does 3 things:

1. fills with random numbers from 1 to 9 the values of the containers vector and map;

2. deletes a random number of elements (no more than 15) in each container;

3. after that, synchronizes so that only the elements in both containers remain in vector and map (do not delete duplicates).
